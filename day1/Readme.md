# Practicing Github (Day1)

Welcome to Day 1 of our Research Software Engineering course! 

Today we will practice basic GitHub collaboration skills.
Please follow the steps below carefully:

## Step-by-Step Tasks

1.	Log into your GitHub account
- Make sure you are signed into GitHub.
2.	Fork the course repository
- Go to this repository and click the Fork button at the top right.
- This will create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
3.	Create a new file
- Navigate to the day1 folder inside your forked repository.
- Create a new file named YourName.md (replace YourName with your actual name).
- In the first line of your file, write your favourite animal.

4.	Make a Pull Request (PR)
- After creating your file, open a Pull Request to suggest your change back to the original repository (the one you forked from).
- Make sure your Pull Request has a clear title.

5.	Create an Issue and link your Pull Request
- In the original repository (not your fork), create a new Issue.
- In the issue, briefly describe that you have created a Pull Request and link the Pull Request to the Issue.

Tips
- Take your time — it’s more important to understand the process than to rush.
- If you get stuck, ask for help — collaboration is a key skill!
