# 💻 Practicing GitHub (Day 1)

Welcome to **Day 1** of our **Research Software Engineering course**!  
Today, we’ll practice the **foundational skills for collaborating on GitHub**:  
**Forking, editing, creating issues, and submitting pull requests**.

Take your time — today is about **learning the process**, not just completing tasks quickly.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Tasks

### 1️⃣ Log into your GitHub account

- Make sure you're signed into [https://github.com](https://github.com).
- If you don’t have an account yet, [create one here](https://github.com/join).

---

### 2️⃣ Fork the course repository

> This step creates your **own copy** of the course repo, where you can make changes safely.

- Go to the course GitHub repository.
- Click the **🔱 Fork** button (top right of the page).
- GitHub will create a copy of the repository under **your username**.

✅ You now have your own editable version of the course repo.

---

### 3️⃣ Create a new file in the `day1/` folder

> This simulates contributing a small piece of content to a shared project.

- In your **forked repository**, navigate to the `day1/` folder.
- Click **"Add file" ➝ "Create new file"**.
- Name the file: `YourName.md`  
  (replace `YourName` with your actual first name, e.g., `Sophie.md`).
- In the file:
  - On the first line, write:  
    ```
    My favourite animal is: [your animal]
    ```
  - (You can add more lines if you like — have fun with it!)

- Commit the file with a meaningful message, e.g.,  
  `"Add Sophie.md with my favourite animal"`

---

### 4️⃣ Create a Pull Request (PR)

> Pull Requests are how we suggest changes to shared projects.

- Go back to your forked repository’s homepage.
- You should see a prompt saying: **“Compare & pull request”** — click it.
- If not, go to the **"Pull Requests"** tab and click **"New Pull Request"**.
- Make sure the base repo is the **original course repo**, and you're comparing from your fork.
- Give your PR a clear title (e.g., `"Add Sophie.md with my favourite animal"`).
- Click **"Create Pull Request"**.

✅ You’ve just proposed a change to a shared codebase — like a real open-source contributor!

---

### 5️⃣ Create an Issue and link your Pull Request

> Issues help track discussions, bugs, and requests. You'll link your PR to an Issue.

- Go to the **original course repository** (not your fork).
- Click the **"Issues"** tab ➝ **"New Issue"**.
- Title the issue something like:  
  `"My pull request for Day 1 contribution"`
- In the description, explain that you created a markdown file and submitted a pull request.
- Paste the link to your Pull Request into the Issue description.

✅ Submit the Issue.

Bonus: GitHub may auto-link your PR and Issue — if not, you can also add  
`Closes #IssueNumber` to your PR comment to link them.

## 💡 Tips

- Don’t worry if something goes wrong — that’s part of the process!
- Ask for help if you're stuck — collaboration and asking questions are core RSE skills.
- If you're done early, try helping someone else or explore other folders in the repo.
