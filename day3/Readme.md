# Reproducible Research Project - Day 3

Welcome to Day 3 of the Research Software Engineering Course!

In this session, you will practice making your research code reproducible and testable.
You will work inside the provided Jupyter notebook and complete a series of tasks.

ðŸ”¹ Instructions


Carefully read the instructions inside the notebook.

</a>

Fill in the missing code cells where indicated with comments like # TODO: ....

Answer the discussion questions where prompted (short text answers).

If a cell asks you to create a plot or run a test, execute the cell after filling it in.

Careful: your work will not automatically be saved. If you wnat to save it, you can `Create a copy on your Google Drive`

Once finished, make sure all your notebook cells run top to bottom without errors.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tips

You can run a single cell with Shift + Enter.

You can delete the clones repository via running the commented out cell:

`fill in here`

Mkae sure to Restart the Kernel as well.

If you need extra packages, install them at the beginning of the notebook:

`!pip install package-name`

Ask for help if you get stuck â€” everyone struggles sometimes!

ðŸ’¥ What You Will Practice Today

- Assert statements
- Writing simple tests using pytest.
- Runnig your test
- Automating your test
- Documenting your code and your results.

ðŸ“š After You Finish

Save your final Day3.ipynb file.

(Optional) Export your environment:

!pip freeze > requirements.txt

(Optional) Download your updated notebook and requirements file for your portfolio!

Good luck, and have fun learning! ðŸš€
